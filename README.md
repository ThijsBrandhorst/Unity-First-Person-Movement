# First-Person Character Controller for Unity 6

**About:**
This is a first-person character controller designed for Unity 6. It includes a wide range of movement mechanics, making it a versatile template for various projects. The controller is scalable and easily customizable, with well-structured code and parameters that can be adjusted in the Unity Inspector.
The project is ideal for developers looking to implement advanced movement mechanics or use this as a starting point for their own games.

**Features**

    - Basic Movement: Walking, sprinting, crouching.
    - Sliding: Momentum-based sliding, works on slopes and flat surfaces.
    - Wall Running: Supports left, right, upward, and downward wall running.
    - Wall Jumping: Jump off walls to navigate vertical spaces.
    - Climbing: Includes ledge grabbing and wall climbing mechanics.
    - Grappling Hook: Attach to surfaces and swing dynamically.
    - Dual Swinging: Use two grapples simultaneously for complex traversal.

**Getting Started**
Prerequisites

    - Unity 6 or later.

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ThijsBrandhorst/Unity-First-Person-Movement.git
    Open the project in Unity.
    Load the game scene to test all the features.

**Mechanics Overview**
Movement

    Walking and Sprinting: Standard first-person movement with adjustable speeds.
    Crouching: Adjusts player height and movement speed dynamically.
    Sliding: Works with flat surfaces and slopes, uses momentum for realistic behavior.

Advanced Features

    Wall Running: Allows for running along vertical surfaces. Adjustable time limits, force, and detection.
    Wall Jumping: Works with wall detection to enable jumping between surfaces.
    Climbing: Includes ledge detection and smooth animations for climbing walls or grabbing ledges.

Grappling and Swinging

    Grappling Hook: Pull the player toward specific surfaces or swing from them.
    Dual Swinging: Grapple to two points simultaneously for advanced movement.

**Customization**

All mechanics are adjustable through the Unity Inspector. Key parameters include:

    Movement speeds (walking, sprinting, crouching).
    Jump force and cooldown.
    Wall run duration and force.
    Grappling hook range and speed.

You can also expand the controller with new features or integrate it into your own game by modifying the included scripts.
